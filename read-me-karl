The purpose of this readme is to ensure that I've documented when I've updated the backups or made changes to the library. 

Namaste, motherfucker.

Geeking out on a rainy day after Thanksgiving. Creating statuscheck.rb to print out a count of the number of files of each type in each image directory. 

Added statuscheck.rb. Purpose of this script is simply to list out the number of picture and video files in each directory for comparison at the end of a sync session:

Year 	Pics 	Vids 
2002	11	0
2003	58	2
2004	397	1
2005	410	5
2006	1330	2
2007	1153	0
2008	2362	23
2009	2726	334
2010	1632	30
2011	827	39
2012	4585	137


At this point I am caught up with everything that is on my work MacBook.

Guess what? It's raining again. It's Sunday, the Patriots beat the Dolphins, and the baby is sleeping. Time to make the donuts.

Goals for today: 
- Clean up extra pictures floating around random areas on the My Book
- Extend script to create a hashmap of all unique images and check for duplicates. 
- Add ability for script to accept command line arguments.
